\section{Hypothesis}
With the assumption that most working IT professionals seek out solutions and asked questions on Stack Overflow, we believe that the Q\&A entries on Stack Overflow could represent a demand of skills in the IT industry. By analyzing the qualities and quantities of the entries on Stack Overflow, we believe that we could apply data mining techniques to extract information regarding future job trends. Therefore, we propose that the level of support for a field on Stack Overflow could predict job demand for that specific field in the future.

We also hypothesize that our scoring metrics will allow us to identify topics that have limited support on Stack Overflow.
