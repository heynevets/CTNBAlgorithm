<p>A very good resource for source control in general. Not really TortoiseSVN specific, though.</p>"
124,26,2008-08-01T16:09:47Z,80,12,"<p>I wound up using this. It is a kind of a hack, but it actually works pretty well. The only thing is you have to be very careful with your semicolons. : D</p>

<pre><code>var strSql:String = stream.readUTFBytes(stream.bytesAvailable);      
var i:Number = 0;
var strSqlSplit:Array = strSql.split("";"");
for (i = 0; i &lt; strSqlSplit.length; i++){

199,50,2008-08-01T19:36:46Z,180,1,"<p>I've read somewhere the human eye can't distinguish between less than 4 values apart. so This is something to keep in mind. The following algorithm does not compensate for this.</p>

<p>I'm not sure this is exactly what you want, but this is one way to randomly generate non-repeating color values:</p>

<p>(beware, inconsistent pseudo-code ahead)</p>

<pre><code>//colors entered as 0-255 [R, G, B]<br>colors = []; //holds final colors to be used<br>rand = new Random();<br><br>//assumes n is less than 16,777,216<br>randomGen(int n){<br>   while (len(colors) &lt; n){<br>      //generate a random number between 0,255 for each color<br>      newRed = rand.next(256);<br>      newGreen = rand.next(256);<br>      newBlue = rand.next(256);<br>      temp = [newRed, newGreen, newBlue];<br>      //only adds new colors to the array<br>      if temp not in colors {<br>         colors.append(temp);<br>      }<br>   }<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>One way you could optimize this for better visibility would be to compare the distance between each new color and all the colors in the array:</p>

<pre><code>for item in color{<br>   itemSq = (item[0]^2 + item[1]^2 + item[2]^2])^(.5);<br>   tempSq = (temp[0]^2 + temp[1]^2 + temp[2]^2])^(.5);<br>   dist = itemSq - tempSq;<br>   dist = abs(dist);<br>}<br>//NUMBER can be your chosen distance apart.<br>if dist &lt; NUMBER and temp not in colors {<br>   colors.append(temp);<br>}<br></code></pre>

<p>But this approach would significantly slow down your algorithm.</p>

<p>Another way would be to scrap the randomness and systematically go through every 4 values and add a color to an array in the above example.</p>"
269,91,2008-08-01T23:49:57Z,260,4,"<p>Yes, I thought about that, but I soon figured out that another Domain-Specific-Language (DSL) would be a bit too much.</p>

<p>Essentially, they need to interact with my gamestate in possibly unpredictable ways. For example, a card could have a rule ""When this cards enter play, all your undead minions gain +3 attack against flying enemies, except when the enemy is blessed"". As trading card games are turn based, the GameState Manager will fire OnStageX events and let the cards modify other cards or the GameState in whatever way the card needs.</p>

<p>If I try to create a DSL, I have to implement a rather large feature set and possibly constantly update it, which shifts the maintenance work to another part without actually removing it.</p>

<p>That's why I wanted to stay with a ""real"" .NET language to essentially be able to just fire the event and let the card manipulate the gamestate in whatever way (within the limits of the code access security).</p>"

332,59,2008-08-02T03:00:24Z,330,19,"<p>I would be a bit reluctant to use nested classes here.  What if you created an abstract base class for a ""multimedia driver"" to handle the back-end stuff (workhorse), and a separate class for the front-end work?  The front-end class could take a pointer/reference to an implemented driver class (for the appropriate media type and situation) and perform the abstract operations on the workhorse structure.</p>

<p>My philosophy would be to go ahead and make both structures accessible to the client in a polished way, just under the assumption they would be used in tandem.</p>

<p>I would reference something like a <a href=""http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtextdocument.html"">QTextDocument</a> in Qt.  You provide a direct interface to the bare metal data handling, but pass the authority along to an object like a QTextEdit to do the manipulation.</p>"
344,100,2008-08-02T04:18:15Z,260,6,"<p>You might be able to use IronRuby for that. </p>

<p>Otherwise I'd suggest you have a directory where you place precompiled assemblies. Then you could have a reference in the DB to the assembly and class, and use reflection to load the proper assemblies at runtime.</p>

<p>If you really want to compile at run-time you could use the CodeDOM, then you could use reflection to load the dynamic assembly. <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.csharp.csharpcodeprovider.aspx"">MSDN article which might help</a>.</p>"
359,119,2008-08-02T06:16:23Z,260,5,"<P>You could use any of the DLR languages, which provide a way to really easily host your own scripting platform. However, you don't have to use a scripting language for this. You could use C# and compile it with the C# code provider. As long as you load it in its own AppDomain, you can load and unload it to your heart's content.</P>"
473,49,2008-08-02T15:33:13Z,470,8,"<p>No, what you're doing is fine. Don't let those people confuse you.</p>

<p>If you've written the web services with .net then the reference proxies generated by .net are going to be quite suitable. The situation you describe (where you are both producer and consumer) is the ideal situation.</p>

<p>If you need to connect to a web services that is <em>unknown</em> at compile time, then you would want a more dynamic approach, where you deduce the 'shape' of the web service. </p>

<p>But start by using the auto generated proxy class, and don't worry about it until you hit a limitation. And when you do -- come back to stack overflow ;-)</p>"
529,86,2008-08-02T18:16:07Z,180,3,"<p>Isn't it also a factor which order you set up the colors?</p>

<p>Like if you use Dillie-Os idea you need to mix the colors as much as possible. 
0 64 128 256 is from one to the next. but 0 256 64 128 in a wheel would be more ""apart""</p>

<p>Does this make sense?</p>"
539,157,2008-08-02T19:03:52Z,180,21,"<p>My first thought on this is ""how generate N vectors in a space that maximize distance from each other."" You can see that the RGB (or any other scale you use that forms a basis in color space) are just vectors. Take a look at <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/RandomPointPicking.html"">Random Point Picking</a>. Hope this is a good start for you! Once you have a set of vectors that are maximized a part, you can save them in a hash table or something for later, and just perform random rotations on them to get all the colors you desire that are maximally apart from each other!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thinking about this problem more, it would be better to map the colors in a linear manor, possibly (0,0,0) --> (255,255,255) lexicographically, and then distribute them evenly. I really don't know how well this will work, but it should since, lets say:</p>

<p>n = 10
we know we have 16777216 colors (256^3). We can use <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/561/using-combinations-of-sets-as-test-data#794"">buckles algorithm 515</a> to find the lexicographically indexed color.<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gEuCs.gif"" alt=""\frac {\binom {256^3} {3}} {n} * i"">. You'll probably have to edit the algorithm to avoid overflow and probably add some minor speed improvements.</p>"
585,149,2008-08-02T23:40:04Z,580,13,"<p>For my projects I alternate between SQL Compare from REd Gate and the Database Publishing Wizard from Microsoft which you can download free

<p>The Wizard isn't as slick as SQL Compare or SQL Data Compare but it does the trick. One issue is that the scripts it generates may need some rearranging and/or editing to flow in one shot.</p>

<p>On the up side, it can move your schema and data which isn't bad for a free tool.</p>"
586,34,2008-08-02T23:51:09Z,580,17,"<p>I've taken to hand-coding all of my DDL (creates/alter/delete) statements, adding them to my .sln as text files, and using normal versioning (using subversion, but any revision control should work). This way, I not only get the benefit of versioning, but updating live from dev/stage is the same process for code and database - tags, branches and so on work all the same.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I agree redgate is expensive if you don't have a company buying it for you. If you can get a company to buy it for you though, it really is worth it!</p>"
590,116,2008-08-03T00:22:03Z,580,2,"<p>If you have a company buying it, Toad from Quest Software has this kind of management functionality built in.  It's basically a two-click operation to compare two schemas and generate a sync script from one to the other.</p>

<p>They have editions for most of the popular databases, including of course Sql Server.</p>"
591,111,2008-08-03T00:37:03Z,580,3,"<p>I work the same way Karl does, by keeping all of my SQL scripts for creating and altering tables in a text file that I keep in source control.  In fact, to avoid the problem of having to have a script examine the live database to determine what ALTERs to run, I usually work like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>On the first version, I place everything during testing into one SQL script, and treat all tables as a CREATE.  This means I end up dropping and readding tables a lot during testing, but that's not a big deal early into the project (since I'm usually hacking the data I'm using at that point anyway).</li>
<li>On all subsequent versions, I do two things: I make a new text file to hold the upgrade SQL scripts, that contain just the ALTERs for that version.  And I make the changes to the original, create a fresh database script as well.  This way an upgrade just runs the upgrade script, but if we have to recreate the DB we don't need to run 100 scripts to get there.</li>
<li>Depending on how I'm deploying the DB changes, I'll also usually put a version table in the DB that holds the version of the DB.  Then, rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run, whatever code I have running the create/upgrade scripts uses the version to determine what to run.</li>
</ul>

<p>The one thing this will not do is help if part of what you're moving from test to production is data, but if you want to manage structure and not pay for a nice, but expensive DB management package, is really not very difficult.  I've also found it's a pretty good way of keeping mental track of your DB.</p>"
597,76,2008-08-03T01:38:02Z,580,1,"<p>I agree that scripting everything is the best way to go and is what I advocate at work.  You should script everything from DB and object creation to populating your lookup tables.</p>

<p>Anything you do in UI only won't translate (especially for changes... not so much for first deployments) and will end up requiring a tools like what Redgate offers.</p>"
655,91,2008-08-03T11:41:38Z,650,69,"<p>With the ""Built in"" stuff, you can't, as using 1.0.* or 1.0.0.* will replace the revision and build numbers with a coded date/timestamp, which is usually also a good way. </p>

<p><strong>HERE BE DRAGONS</strong></p>

<p>Let's say Joe and Jane regularly log onto the computer, then they will each have 'registries'.</p>

<p>You'll then install your app, and the installer will employ giant hacks and disgusting things to set items under HKCU for them.</p>

<p>THEN, bob will come along and log on (he, and 500 other people have accounts in the domain and so can do this). He's never used this computer before, so he has no registry. The first time he logs in, windows creates him one, but he won't have your setting. </p>

<p>Your app then falls over or behaves incorrectly, and bob complains loudly about those crappy products from raynixon incorporated.</p>

<p>The correct answer is to just have some default settings in your app, which can write them to the registry if it doesn't find them. It's general good practice that your app should never depend on the registry, and should create things as needed, for any registry entry, not just HKCU, anyway</p>"

Rather it writes to HKCU if you select Just Me and HKLM if you select Everyone.</p>

<p>So my solution is going to be to use the User/Machine Hive, and then in the application it checks if the registry entries are in HKCU and if not, copies them from HKLM. I know this probably isn't the most ideal way of doing it, but it has the least amount of changes.</p>"

<p>When the applications restarted (note we didn't need to reboot the machine), they loaded the new <code>mfc42.dll</code>, and all was well. That, coupled with <code>PendingFileOperations</code> to delete the old one the next time the whole system restarted, worked pretty well.</p>"

<LI>If you don't know which process has the file locked, you'll need to examine each process's handle list, and query each handle to determine if it identifies the locked file. Doing this in C# will likely require P/Invoke or an intermediary C++/CLI to call the native APIs you'll need.</LI>
<LI>Once you've figured out which process(es) have the file locked, you'll need to safely inject a small native DLL into the process (you can also inject a managed DLL, but this is messier, as you then have to start or attach to the .NET runtime).</LI>

<p>Now all of the domains will trigger the vhost for our project.  The final part is to decode the domain name actually used so that you can work out the username in your code, something like (PHP):</p>

<pre><code>list( $username ) = explode( ""."", $_SERVER[ ""HTTP_HOST"" ] );

<p>For example, none of those numbers (nor, likely, any combination of them) can be used to tell you exactly how many such processes can run at once in a given amount of free memory.  But really, your best bet is to come at it from that end: why do you want this number, and what will you use it for?  Given that information, I think you'll get more useful answers.</p>"

<p>Why it is useful in programming? No idea, but i assume it's because you can get rid of some brackets? I am a quite defensive programmer, so my lines can look like this:</p>

<pre><code>result = (((i + 4) - (a + b)) * MAGIC_NUMBER) - ANOTHER_MAGIC_NUMBER;
</code></pre>

<p>with BODMAS you can make this a bit clearer:</p>

<pre><code>result = (i + 4 - (a + b)) * MAGIC_NUMBER - ANOTHER_MAGIC_NUMBER;
</code></pre>

<p>I think i'd still use the first variant - more brackets, but that way i do not have to learn yet another rule and i run into less risk of forgetting it and causing those weird hard to debug errors?</p>

<P>That means all of the queries written above with the % and _ are not valid full text queries.</P>

<P>In order for the CONTAINSTABLE function to know that I'm using a wildcard search, I have to wrap it in double quotes. I can use the wildcard character * at the beginning or ending. There are a lot of other things you can do when you're building the search string for the CONTAINSTABLE function. You can search for a word near another word, search for inflectional words (drive = drives, drove, driving, and driven), and search for synonym of another word (metal can have synonyms such as aluminum and steel).</P>

<P>[Update]</P>
<P>I see that you've updated your question and know that you need to use one of the functions.</P>
<P>You can still search with the wildcard at the beginning, but if the word is not a full word following the wildcard, you have to add another wildcard at the end.</P>Example:  ""*ildcar"" will look for a single word as long as it ends with ""ildcar"".<BR><BR>Example:  ""*ildcar*"" will look for a single word with ""ildcar"" in the middle, which means it will match ""wildcard"".

<p>Loading libA before libB should work, unless one of those libraries has a dependency that is unaccounted for and not in the path. My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure </p>

<p>If you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first. Then the OS doesn't try to find a library that isn't in your path. It's klunky and a bit painful, but ensuring Java finds them and loads them all in the correct order can work.</p>"

5607,581,2008-08-08T03:04:29Z,5600,31,"<p>When dealing with indexes, you have to determine what your table is going to be used for.  If you are primarily inserting 1000 rows a second and not doing any querying, then a clustered index is a hit to performance.  If you are doing 1000 queries a second, then not having an index will lead to very bad performance.  The best thing to do when trying to tune queries/indexes is to use the Query Plan Analyzer and SQL Profiler in SQL Server.  This will show you where you are running into costly table scans or other performance blockers.</p>

<p>As for the GUID vs ID argument, you can find people online that swear by both.  I have always been taught to use GUIDs unless I have a really good reason not to.  Jeff has a good post that talks about the reasons for using GUIDs: <a href=""http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html"">http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html</a>.</p>

<p>As with most anything development related, if you are looking to improve performance there is not one, single right answer.  It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish and how you are implementing the solution.  The only true answer is to test, test, and test again against performance metrics to ensure that you are meeting your goals.</p>

<p>[Edit]
@Matt, after doing some more research on the GUID/ID debate I came across this post.  Like I mentioned before, there is not a true right or wrong answer.  It depends on your specific implementation needs.  But these are some pretty valid reasons to use GUIDs as the primary key:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, there is an issue known as a ""hotspot"", where certain pages of data in a table are under relatively high currency contention. Basically, what happens is most of the traffic on a table (and hence page-level locks) occurs on a small area of the table, towards the end. New records will always go to this hotspot, because IDENTITY is a sequential number generator. These inserts are troublesome because they require Exlusive page lock on the page they are added to (the hotspot). This effectively serializes all inserts to a table thanks to the page locking mechanism. NewID() on the other hand does not suffer from hotspots. Values generated using the NewID() function are only sequential for short bursts of inserts (where the function is being called very quickly, such as during a multi-row insert), which causes the inserted rows to spread randomly throughout the table's data pages instead of all at the end - thus eliminating a hotspot from inserts.</p>
  
  <p>Also, because the inserts are randomly distributed, the chance of page splits is greatly reduced. While a page split here and there isnt too bad, the effects do add up quickly. With IDENTITY, page Fill Factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100% - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one. With NewID(), you can actually make use of Fill Factor as a performance-enabling tool. You can set Fill Factor to a level that approximates estimated volume growth between index rebuilds, and then schedule the rebuilds during off-peak hours using dbcc reindex. This effectively delays the performance hits of page splits until off-peak times.</p>
  
  <p>If you even <em>think</em> you might need to enable replication for the table in question - then you might as well make the PK a uniqueidentifier and flag the guid field as ROWGUIDCOL. Replication will require a uniquely valued guid field with this attribute, and it will add one if none exists. If a suitable field exists, then it will just use the one thats there.</p>
  
  <p>Yet another huge benefit for using GUIDs for PKs is the fact that the value is indeed guaranteed unique - not just among all values generated by <em>this</em> server, but all values generated by <em>all</em> computers - whether it be your db server, web server, app server, or client machine. Pretty much every modern language has the capability of generating a valid guid now - in .NET you can use System.Guid.NewGuid. This is VERY handy when dealing with cached master-detail datasets in particular. You dont have to employ crazy temporary keying schemes just to relate your records together before they are committed. You just fetch a perfectly valid new Guid from the operating system for each new record's permanent key value at the time the record is created. </p>

<p>If you do decide to roll your own, I'd recommend using the email address. Be careful, though, if you are creating something that groups users by an account (say, a company that has several users). In this case, the email address might be used more than once (if they do work for more than one company, for example), and you should allow that.</p>

<li>Set a threshold score such that any MatchScore &lt; Threshold will not be considered a match for a given CompanyName.</li>

That would avoid a fair bit of text duplication in this table (over 18,000 rows, an integer foreign key would save quite a bit of space over a varchar column).</p>

<p>But you're still faced with a method for loading that Company table and then properly associating it with the rows in Location. There's no general solution, but you could do something along these lines:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create the Company table, with an id column that auto-increments (depends on your RDBMS).</li>
<li>Find all of the unique company names and insert them into Company.</li>
<li>Add a column, company_id, to Location that accepts NULLs (for now) and that is a foreign key of the Company.id column.</li>
<li>For each row in Location, determine the corresponding company, and UPDATE that row's company_id column with that company's id. This is likely the most challenging step. If your data is like what you show in the example, you'll likely have to take many runs at this with various string matching approaches.</li>
<li>Once all rows in Location have a company_id value, then you can ALTER the Company table to add a NOT NULL constraint to the company_id column (assuming that every location <em>must</em> have a company, which seems reasonable).</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can make a copy of your Location table, you can gradually build up a series of SQL statements to populate the company_id foreign key. If you make a mistake, you can just start over and rerun the script up to the point of failure.</p>"

You could use the old-school C way and call fopen/fread/fclose, or you could use the C++ fstream facilities (ifstream/ofstream), or if you're using MFC, use the CFile class, which provides functions to accomplish actual file operations.</p>

<p>All of these are suitable for both text and binary, though none have a specific readline functionality. What you'd most likely do instead in that case is use the fstream classes (fstream.h) and use the stream operators (&lt;&lt; and >>) or the read function to read/write blocks of text:</p>

<pre><code>int nsize = 10;
char *somedata;
ifstream myfile;
myfile.open(""&lt;path to file&gt;"");
myfile.read(somedata,nsize);
myfile.close();

<p>Note that, if you're using Visual Studio 2005 or higher, traditional fstream may not be available (there's a new Microsoft implementation, which is slightly different, but accomplishes the same thing).</p>"
7888,872,2008-08-11T15:59:48Z,7880,24,"<p>You need to use an <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ifstream""><code>ifstream</code></a> if you just want to read (use an <code>ofstream</code> to write, or an <code>fstream</code> for both).</p>

<p>To open a file in text mode, do the following:</p>

<pre><code>ifstream in(""filename.ext"", ios_base::in); // the in flag is optional
</code></pre>

<p>To open a file in binary mode, you just need to add the ""binary"" flag.</p>

<pre><code>ifstream in2(""filename2.ext"", ios_base::in | ios_base::binary ); 
</code></pre>

<p>Use the <a href=""http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_istream/read""><code>ifstream.read()</code></a> function to read a block of characters (in binary or text mode).

<p>The problem with a classic example is that you are forced to close the file by yourself, meaning that you will have to bend your architecture to this need. RAII makes use of the automatic destructor call in C++ to close the file for you.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: seems that std::fstream already implements RAII so the code below is useless. I'll keep it here for posterity and as an example of RAII. </p>

<pre><code>class FileOpener
{
public:
    FileOpener(std::fstream&amp; file, const char* fileName): m_file(file)
    { 
        m_file.open(fileName); 
    }
    ~FileOpeneer()
    { 
        file.close(); 
    }

private:
    std::fstream&amp; m_file;
};
</code></pre>

<p>You can now use this class in your code like this:</p>

<pre><code>int nsize = 10;
char *somedata;
ifstream myfile;
FileOpener opener(myfile, ""&lt;path to file&gt;"");
myfile.read(somedata,nsize);
// myfile is closed automatically when opener destructor is called

<p>In a situation where you have perpetual access to the code, I don't think standards-compliance is all that important, since you can always make changes to the code if something breaks. If you don't have perpetual access (ie, you sign off on the code and it becomes someone else's responsibility), it's probably best to be as standards-compliant as possible to minimize maintenance headaches later... even if you never have to deal with the code again, your reputation persists and can be transmitted to other potential clients, and many teams like to blame the previous developer(s) for problems that come up.</p>

Doing it once the right way minimises this problem (though does not entirely mitigate it).</p>

8157,872,2008-08-11T20:00:09Z,8140,3,"<p>This is generally something that you'll have to expose yourself, so yes, it will be dependent on the language your system is written in (though often it's possible to write wrappers for other languages as well).</p>

<p>If, for example, you had a program written in C, for Windows, plugins would be written for your program as DLLs.  At runtime, you would manually load these DLLs, and expose some interface to them.  For example, the DLLs might expose a <code>gimme_the_interface()</code> function which could accept a structure filled with function pointers.  These function pointers would allow the DLL to make calls, register callbacks, etc.</p>

<p>If you were in C++, you would use the DLL system, except you would probably pass an object pointer instead of a struct, and the object would implement an interface which provided functionality (accomplishing the same thing as the struct, but less ugly).  For Java, you would load class files on-demand instead of DLLs, but the basic idea would be the same.</p>

<p>In all cases, you'll need to define a standard interface between your code and the plugins, so that you can initialize the plugins, and so the plugins can interact with you.</p>

<p>P.S. If you'd like to see a good example of a C++ plugin system, check out the <a href=""http://foobar2000.com/SDK.html"" rel=""nofollow"">foobar2000 SDK</a>.  I haven't used it in quite a while, but it used to be really well done.  I assume it still is.</p>"
8164,521,2008-08-11T20:06:53Z,8140,4,"<p>I've used event-based APIs for plugins in the past. You can insert hooks for plugins by dispatching events and providing access to the application state.</p>

<p>For example, if you were writing a blogging application, you might want to raise an event just before a new post is saved to the database, and provide the post HTML to the plugin to alter as needed.</p>

8173,1026,2008-08-11T20:15:06Z,8140,2,"<p>I'm tempted to point you to the Design Patterns book for this generic question :p</p>

<p>Seriously, I think the answer is no. You can't write extensible code by default, it will be both hard to write/extend and awfully inefficient (Mozilla started with the idea of being very extensible, used XPCOM everywhere, and now they realized it was a mistake and started to remove it where it doesn't make sense).</p>

<p>what makes sense to do is to identify the pieces of your system that can be meaningfully extended and support a proper API for these cases (e.g. language support plug-ins in an editor). You'd use the relevant patterns, but the specific implementation depends on your platform/language choice.</p>

<p>IMO, it also helps to use a dynamic language - makes it possible to tweak the core code at run time (when absolutely necessary). I appreciated that Mozilla's extensibility works that way when writing Firefox extensions.</p>

Both Python and Lua are excellent languages that are used to script a large number of applications (Civ4 and blender use Python, Supreme Commander uses Lua, etc).  </p>

<p>If you are using C++, check out the boost python library.  Otherwise, python ships with headers that can be used in C, and does a fairly good job documenting the C/python API.

<p>The best option is to have the service store the data and have a user-launched application do the printing by asking the service for the data. Or a common location that the data is stored, like a database. </p>

<p>If you need to have the data printed as regular intervals, setup a Task event thru the Task Scheduler. Launching a process from a service will require knowing the user name and password, which again is bad security practice.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you mean by that the data tier should not be aware of the business logic tier? How would you fill an business object with data?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The UI asks the ServiceClass in the business tier for a service, namely getting a list of objects filtered by an object with the needed parameter data.<br />
Then the ServiceClass creates an instance of one of the repository classes in the data tier, and calls the GetList(ParameterType filters).<br />
Then the data tier accesses the database, pulls up the data, and maps it to the common format defined in the ""domain"" assembly.<br />
The BL has no more work to do with this data, so it outputs it to the UI.</p>

<p>Then the UI wants to edit Item X. It sends the item (or business object) to the service in the Business Tier. The business tier validates the object, and if it is OK, it sends it to the data tier for storage.</p>

<p>The UI knows the service in the business tier which again knows about the data tier.</p>

<p>The UI is responsible for mapping the users data input to and from the objects, and the data tier is responsible for mapping the data in the db to and from the objects. The Business tier stays purely business. :)</p>

If I'm understanding your problem correctly, it sounds like you're trying to satisfy too much with a single interface, and that's just causing it to become cluttered.  Why not have two interfaces into the business layer?  One would be a simple, safe interface for the UI layer.  The other would be a lower-level interface for the data layer.</p>

<p>You can apply this two-interface approach to any objects which need to be passed to both the UI and the data layers, too.</p>

<p>It is possible to inherit and implement both set of interfaces such that:</p>

<p>This way, in your data layer you only need to see the interface implementation of IData, while in your UI you only need to see the interface implementation of IView.</p>

<p>Another strategy you might want to use is to compose your objects in the UI or Data layers such that they are merely consumed by these layers, e.g.,</p>

<pre><code>public class BusinessObject : DomainObject

public class ViewManager&lt;T&gt; where T : DomainObject

"
9413,184,2008-08-13T02:22:24Z,9410,449,"<p><strong>Declaration</strong></p>

<p>A prototype for a function which takes a function parameter looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>void func ( void (*f)(int) );
</code></pre>

<p>This states that the parameter <code>f</code> will be a pointer to a function which has a <code>void</code> return type and which takes a single <code>int</code> parameter. The following function (<code>print</code>) is an example of a function which could be passed to <code>func</code> as a parameter because it is the proper type:</p>

<pre><code>void print ( int x ) {
  printf(""%d\n"", x);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Function Call</strong></p>

<p>When calling a function with a function parameter, the value passed must be a pointer to a function. Use the function's name (without parentheses) for this:</p>

<pre><code>func(print);
</code></pre>

<p>would call <code>func</code>, passing the print function to it.</p>

<p><strong>Function Body</strong></p>

<p>As with any parameter, func can now use the parameter's name in the function body to access the value of the parameter. Let's say that func will apply the function it is passed to the numbers 0-4. Consider, first, what the loop would look like to call print directly:</p>

<pre><code>for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr &lt; 5 ; ctr++ ) {
  print(ctr);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>func</code>'s parameter declaration says that <code>f</code> is the name for a pointer to the desired function, we recall first that if <code>f</code> is a pointer then <code>*f</code> is the thing that <code>f</code> points to (i.e. the function <code>print</code> in this case). As a result, just replace every occurrence of print in the loop above with <code>*f</code>:</p>

<pre><code>void func ( void (*f)(int) ) {
  for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr &lt; 5 ; ctr++ ) {
    (*f)(ctr);
  }
}

9421,716,2008-08-13T02:34:47Z,9410,81,"<p>This question already has the answer for defining function pointers, however they can get very messy, especially if you are going to be passing them around your application. To avoid this unpleasantness I would recommend that you typedef the function pointer into something more readable. For example.</p>

<pre><code>typedef void (*functiontype)();
</code></pre>

<p>Declares a function that returns void and takes no arguments. To create a function pointer to this type you can now do:</p>

<pre><code>void dosomething() { }

functiontype func = &amp;dosomething;
func();
</code></pre>

<p>For a function that returns an int and takes a char you would do</p>

<pre><code>typedef int (*functiontype2)(char);
</code></pre>

<pre><code>int dosomethingwithchar(char a) { return 1; }

functiontype2 func2 = &amp;dosomethingwithchar
int result = func2('a');

<p>There are libraries that can help with turning function pointers into nice readable types. The <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_36_0/doc/html/function.html"">boost function</a> library is great and is well worth the effort!</p>

<pre><code>boost::function&lt;int (char a)&gt; functiontype2;

9502,1131,2008-08-13T06:08:24Z,9240,7,"<p>If I understand the question correctly, you've created a domain model and you would like to write an object-relational mapper to map between records in your database and your domain objects. However, you're concerned about polluting your domain model with the 'plumbing' code that would be necessary to read and write to your object's fields.</p>

<p>Taking a step back, you essentially have two choices of where to put your data mapping code - within the domain class itself or in an external mapping class.
The first option is often called the Active Record pattern and has the advantage that each object knows how to persist itself and has sufficient access to its internal structure to allow it to perform the mapping without needing to expose non-business related fields.</p>

<p>E.g</p>

<pre><code>public class User
{
	private string name;
	private AccountStatus status;

	private User()
	{
	}

	public string Name
	{
		get { return name; }
		set { name = value; }
	}

	public AccountStatus Status
	{
		get { return status; }
	}

	public void Activate()
	{
		status = AccountStatus.Active;
	}

	public void Suspend()
	{
		status = AccountStatus.Suspended;
	}

	public static User GetById(int id)
	{
		User fetchedUser = new User();

		// Lots of database and error-checking code
		// omitted for clarity
		// ...

		fetchedUser.name = (string) reader[""Name""];
		fetchedUser.status = (int)reader[""statusCode""] == 0 ? AccountStatus.Suspended : AccountStatus.Active;

		return fetchedUser;
	}

	public static void Save(User user)
	{
		// Code to save User's internal structure to database
		// ...
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, we have an object that represents a User with a Name and an AccountStatus. We don't want to allow the Status to be set directly, perhaps because we want to check that the change is a valid status transition, so we don't have a setter. Fortunately, the mapping code in the GetById and Save static methods have full access to the object's name and status fields.</p>

<p>The second option is to have a second class that is responsible for the mapping. This has the advantage of seperating out the different concerns of business logic and persistence which can allow your design to be more testable and flexible. The challenge with this method is how to expose the name and status fields to the external class. Some options are:
  1. Use reflection (which has no qualms about digging deep into your object's private parts)
  2. Provide specially-named, public setters (e.g. prefix them with the word 'Private') and hope no one uses them accidentally
  3. If your language suports it, make the setters internal but grant your data mapper module access. E.g. use the InternalsVisibleToAttribute in .NET 2.0 onwards or friend functions in C++</p>

<p>For more information, I'd recommend Martin Fowler's classic book 'Patterns of Enterprise Architecture'</p>

<p>However, as a word of warning, before going down the path of writing your own mappers I'd strongly recommend looking at using a 3rd-party object relational mapper (ORM) tool such as nHibernate or Microsoft's Entity Framework. I've worked on four different projects where, for various reasons, we wrote our own mapper and it is very easy to waste a lot of time maintaining and extending the mapper instead of writing code that provides end user value. I've used nHibernate on one project so far and, although it has quite a steep learning curve initially, the investment you put in early on pays off considerably.</p>"

<p>I think many developers think of the database as a simple persistence layer for their objects, and are only concerned with the CRUD operations that those objects need.  Too much effort is being put into the ""impedence mismatch"" between object and relational models.  Here's an idea: stop trying.</p>

<p>Write stored procedures to encapsulate your data.  Use results sets, DataSet, DataTable, SqlCommand (or the java/php/whatever equivalent) as needed from code to interact with the database.  You don't need those objects.  An excellent example is embedding a SqlDataSource into a .ASPX page.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are two ways to use Automation (or OLE Automation) to
  programmatically control another application.</p>
  
  <p>Late binding uses CreateObject to create and instance of the
  application object, which you can then control. For example, to create
  a new instance of Excel using late binding:</p>

<pre><code> Dim oXL As Object
 Set oXL = CreateObject(""Excel.Application"")
</code></pre>
  
  <p>On the other hand, to manipulate an existing instance of Excel (if
  Excel is already open) you would use GetObject (regardless whether
  you're using early or late binding):</p>

<pre><code> Dim oXL As Object
 Set oXL = GetObject(, ""Excel.Application"")
</code></pre>
  
  <p>To use early binding, you first need to set a reference in your
  project to the application you want to manipulate. In the VB Editor of
  any Office application, or in VB itself, you do this by selecting
  Tools + References, and selecting the application you want from the
  list (e.g. “Microsoft Excel 8.0 Object Library”).</p>
  
  <p>To create a new instance of Excel using early binding:</p>

<pre><code> Dim oXL As Excel.Application
 Set oXL = New Excel.Application
</code></pre>
  
  <p>In either case, incidentally, you can first try to get an existing
  instance of Excel, and if that returns an error, you can create a new
  instance in your error handler.</p>
</blockquote>"
10582,1190,2008-08-14T02:16:42Z,10580,12,"<p>In compiled languages, the difference is stark.</p>

<p>Java:</p>

<pre><code>//early binding:
public create_a_foo(*args) {
 return new Foo(args)
}
my_foo = create_a_foo();

//late binding:
public create_something(Class klass, *args) {
  klass.new_instance(args)
}
my_foo = create_something(Foo);
</code></pre>

<p>In the first example, the compiler can do all sorts of neat stuff at compile time.  In the second, you just have to hope that whoever uses the method does so responsibly.  (Of course, newer JVMs support the <code>Class&lt;? extends Foo&gt; klass</code> structure, which can greatly reduce this risk.)</p>

<p>Another benefit is that IDEs can hotlink to the class definition, since it's declared right there in the method.  The call to create<em>something(Foo) might be _very</em> far from the method definition, and if you're looking at the method definition, it might be nice to see the implementation.</p>

<p>The major advantage of late binding is that it makes things like inversion-of-control easier, as well as certain other uses of polymorphism and duck-typing (if your language supports such things).</p>
"
10584,1190,2008-08-14T02:21:56Z,10580,2,"<p>In interpreted languages, the difference is a little more subtle.</p>

# late binding:
def create_something(klass, *args)
  klass.new(*args)
end
my_foo = create_something(Foo)
</code></pre>

<p>Because Ruby is (generally) not compiled, there isn't a compiler to do the nifty up-front stuff.  The growth of JRuby means that more Ruby is compiled these days, though, making it act more like Java, above.</p>

<p>The issue with IDEs still stands: a platform like Eclipse can look up class definitions if you hard-code them, but cannot if you leave them up to the caller.</p>

<p>Inversion-of-control is not terribly popular in Ruby, probably because of its extreme runtime flexibility, but Rails makes great use of late binding to reduce the amount of configuration necessary to get your application going.</p>

<p>First, see if there is another API call to determine exit status... a quick glance and I don't see one, but I am not well versed in the standard C API.</p>

<p>An easy alternative is to have a global variable that stores the exit status... the default being an unknown error cause (for if the program terminates abnormally).  Then, when you call exit, you can store the exit status in the global and retrieve it from any atexit functions.  This requires storing the exit status diligently before every exit call, and clearly is not ideal, but if there is no API and you don't want to risk <code>on_exit</code> not being on the platform... it might be the only option.</p>

I expect that it isn't set yet at the point when <code>atexit()</code> is called, anyway.  By this I mean that the runtime knows what it is, but probably hasn't reported it to the OS.  This is pretty much just conjecture, though.</p>

<p>It looks like you will either need to use <code>on_exit()</code> or structure your program so that the exit code doesn't matter.  It would not be unreasonable to have the last statement in your main function flip a global <code>exited_cleanly</code> variable to true.  In the function you register with <code>atexit()</code>, you could check this variable to determine how the program exited.  This will only give you two states, but I expect that would be sufficient for most needs.  You could also expand this type of scheme to support more exit states if necessary.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I do this:</p>

<pre><code>public void GetFoosById(IList&lt;Foo&gt; foos, int id) { ... }

<p>This lets me pass in a plain old List if that's all I need, or a more intelligent implementation of IList&lt;T&gt; (like ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;) if I plan to bind to it from the UI. This technique also lets me return stuff from the method like a ValidationResult containing an error message if one occurred.</p>

<ol>
<li>Have the last argument in your prototype be a void*. This gives you flexibility of passing in anything else that you need, but it definitely isn't type-safe.</li>

I am <em>guessing</em> that .NET contacts some web site which reports it back.  There are a couple ways to go.  First, a deeper look into the ICMP protocol may give you the information you need.  You can also trace the IP you go through (your route).  When you encounter an IP that is not in the following ranges:</p>

<ul>
<li>10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255</li>
<li>172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255</li>

12210,1117,2008-08-15T12:57:22Z,12140,1,"<p>I like to model my configuration access off of the Service Locator pattern.  This gives me a single point to get any configuration value that I need and by putting it outside the application in a separate library, it allows reuse and testability.  Here is some sample code, I am not sure what language you are using, but I wrote it in C#.</p>

<p>First I create a generic class that will models my ConfigurationItem.</p>

<pre><code>public class ConfigurationItem&lt;T&gt;
{
    private T item;

    public ConfigurationItem(T item)
    {
        this.item = item;
    }

    public T GetValue()
    {
        return item;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I create a class that exposes public static readonly variables for the configuration item.  Here I am just reading the ConnectionStringSettings from a config file, which is just xml.  Of course for more items, you can read the values from any source.</p>

<pre><code>public class ConfigurationItems
{
    public static ConfigurationItem&lt;ConnectionStringSettings&gt; ConnectionSettings = new ConfigurationItem&lt;ConnectionStringSettings&gt;(RetrieveConnectionString());

    private static ConnectionStringSettings RetrieveConnectionString()
    {
        // In .Net, we store our connection string in the application/web config file.
        // We can access those values through the ConfigurationManager class.
        return ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""ConnectionKey""]];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then when I need a ConfigurationItem for use, I call it like this:</p>

<pre><code>ConfigurationItems.ConnectionSettings.GetValue();
</code></pre>

<p>And it will return me a type safe value, which I can then cache or do whatever I want with.</p>

<p>Here's a sample test:</p>

<pre><code>[TestFixture]
public class ConfigurationItemsTest
{
    [Test]
    public void ShouldBeAbleToAccessConnectionStringSettings()
    {
        ConnectionStringSettings item = ConfigurationItems.ConnectionSettings.GetValue();
        Assert.IsNotNull(item);
    }
}

<p>We are using DB2, and there is a command called db2expln and db2advis, the first will indicate whether table scans vs index scans are being used, and the second will recommend indexes you can add to improve performance.  I'm sure MySQL has similar tools...</p>

<p>Anyways, if this is something you haven't considered yet, it has been helping a lot with me... but if you've already gone this route, then I guess it's not what you are looking for.</p>

<p>Another possibility is a ""materialized view"" (or as they call it in DB2), which lets you specify a table that is essentially built of parts from multiple tables.  Thus, rather than normalizing the actual columns, you could provide this view to access the data... but I don't know if this has severe performance impacts on inserts/updates/deletes (but if it is ""materialized"", then it should help with selects since the values are physically stored separately).</p>"

Just consider each piece of your array an object, or, at the very least, the first level of the array as an object and each sub level as variables inside the object. The build a data structure that you populate with said objects and access the objects through the data structure's given accessors.</p>

<p>Something like:</p>

Wing is quite right that these should probably be <strong><em>constants</em></strong> (or maybe enums).</p>

<p>What Bruce needs, at it's heart, is simply a lookup table.  He doesn't need a hierarchy of objects and interfaces; he needs a way to look up a schedule based on a season and a group identifier.  Turning things into objects only makes sense if they have responsibilities or state.  If they have neither, then they are simply identifiers, and building special objects for them just makes the codebase larger.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> build, e.g., <code>Group</code> objects that each contain a set of schedule strings (one for each season), but if all the <code>Group</code> object does is provide lookup functionality, then you've reinvented the lookup table in a much less intuitive fashion.  If he has to look up the group, and then lookup the schedule, all he has is a two-step lookup table that took longer to code, is more likely to be buggy, and will be harder to maintain.</p>

<p>That being said, once you are satisifed with your indexes and have exhausted all other avenues, de-normalization might be the right answer.  If you just have one or two queries that are problems, a manual approach is probably appropriate, whereas some sort of data warehousing tool might be better for creating a platform to develop data cubes.</p>

<p>Here's a site I found that touches on the subject:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D""><a href=""http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D"">http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D</a></a></p>

<p>Here's a simple technique that you can use to keep denormalizing queries simple, if you're just doing a few at a time (and I'm not replacing your OLTP tables, just creating a new one for reporting purposes).  Let's say you have this query in your application:</p>

<pre><code>select a.name, b.address from tbla a 
join tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id where a.id=1
</code></pre>

<p>You could create a denormalized table and populate with almost the same query:</p>

<pre><code>create table tbl_ab (a_id, a_name, b_address); 
-- (types elided)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the underscores match the table aliases you use</p>

<pre><code>insert tbl_ab select a.id, a.name, b.address from tbla a
join tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id 
-- no where clause because you want everything
</code></pre>

<p>Then to fix your app to use the new denormalized table, switch the dots for underscores.  </p>

<pre><code>select a_name as name, b_address as address 
from tbl_ab where a_id = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>For huge queries this can save a lot of time and makes it clear where the data came from, and you can re-use the queries you already have.</p>

<p>Remember, I'm only advocating this as the last resort.  I bet there's a few indexes that would help you.  And when you de-normalize, don't forget to account for the extra space on your disks, and figure out when you will run the query to populate the new tables.  This should probably be at night, or whenever activity is low.  And the data in that table, of course, will never exactly be up to date.</p>

<p>[Yet another edit]  Don't forget that the new tables you create need to be indexed too!  The good part is that you can index to your heart's content and not worry about update lock contention, since aside from your bulk insert the table will only see selects.</p>"

<p>Adding a database is an incredibly heavyweight way to solve a problem that fits easily into a text file (or even directly into the source).  There are 5 groups and 4 seasons.  That means there are going to be a total of <em>20 records</em> in the database.</p>"

<p>One thing i discovered earlier this year on our MySQL databases was the power of composite indexes. For example, if you are reporting on order numbers over date ranges, a composite index on the order number and order date columns could help. I believe MySQL can only use one index for the query so if you just had separate indexes on the order number and order date it would have to decide on just one of them to use. Using the EXPLAIN command can help determine this.</p>

<p>To give an indication of the performance with good indexes (including numerous composite indexes), i can run queries joining 3 tables in our database and get almost instant results in most cases. For more complex reporting most of the queries run in under 10 seconds. These 3 tables have 33 million, 110 million and 140 millions rows respectively. Note that we had also already normalised these slightly to speed up our most common query on the database.</p>

<p>Embedding a DB in Java doesn't make it easier to maintain.  There's now an additional code dependency that did not previously exist.  Updating the set of schedules is now more difficult, as either a custom tool must be coded or a DB-specific interface must be used, whereas previous notepad.exe was sufficient.  Scalability is not a concern here, either.  The needs of this system could increase by a million and the flat file would still work just fine.</p>

<p>Certainly, it's possible that in the future needs will evolve to the point that it's worth moving to a database.  That's when you make the change.  Trying to future-proof an application never works, because we <em>always</em> assume incorrectly about future needs.

If you're just showing the current watering schedule the WateringSchedule class itself can figure out what day it is, and therefore what season it is. Then just have a method which returns a map where the Key is the group letter. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>public Map&lt;String,List&lt;String&gt;&gt; getGroupToScheduledDaysMap() {
  // instantiate a date or whatever to decide what Map to return

<p>The benefit is that if you ever decide to change the way that you handle new lines, you only have to change it in one place.</p>

<p>Of course, a possible negative is that you're calling including an extra function (__autoload()), running that function (when you reference the class), which then loads another file (your class file). That might be more overhead than it's worth.</p>

<p>If I may offer a suggestion, it would be avoiding this sort of echoing that requires echoing tags (like <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>). If you could set up something a little more template-esque, you could handle the nl's without having to explicitly type them. So instead of</p>

<li>Create issues in your bug tracker (ex: issue key of PROJ-123).</li>
<li>When you commit code, add ""PROJ-123"" to your commit comment to indicate what bug this code change fixes.</li>
<li>When your CI server checks out the code, scan the commit comments of the diffs. Record any strings matching the regex of your issue keys.</li>
<li>When the build completes, generate a report of what issue keys were found.</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically to your second problem:</p>

<p>Your CI doesn't doesn't have to put anything into your bug tracker. Bamboo doesn't put anything into JIRA.

<ol>
<li><p>When you use distributed source control, you have the whole source tree on your local machine. You can commit, create branches, and work pretty much as though you were all alone, and then when you're ready to push up your changes, you can promote them from your machine to the master copy. If you're working ""offline"" a lot, this can be a huge benefit.</p></li>

<p>If you had tagged the release, you could check out a working copy of it and use it to fix the bug.</p>

<p>Then, you might choose to create a branch at the tag and check the bug fix into it. That way, you can fix more bugs on that release while you continue to upgrade the trunk. You can also merge those fixes into the trunk so that they'll be present in the next release.</p>

13468,1436,2008-08-17T01:51:00Z,13460,1,"<p>The common standard for setting up Subversion is to have three folders under the root of your repository: trunk, branches and tags.  The trunk folder holds your current ""main"" line of development. For many shops and situations, this is all they ever use... just a single working repository of code.</p>

<p>The tags folder takes it one step further and allows you to ""checkpoint"" your code at certain points in time. For example, when you release a new build or sometimes even when you simply <em>make</em> a new build, you ""tag"" a copy into this folder. This just allows you to know exactly what your code looked like at that point in time.</p>

<p>The branches folder holds different kinds of branches that you might need in special situations. Sometimes a branch is a place to work on experimental feature or features that might take a long time to get stable (therefore you don't want to introduce them into your main line just yet). Other times, a branch might represent the ""production"" copy of your code which can be edited and deployed independently from your main line of code which contains changes intended for a future release.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is just one aspect of how to set up your system, but I think giving some thought to this structure is important.</p>

<p>I agree with @<a href=""#13475"" rel=""nofollow"">Marius</a>, even if his answer is a little terse and may come off as being flippant. Regular expressions are tough, if one's not used to using them, and the {1} in the question isn't quite error - in systems that support it, it does mean ""exactly one match"". In this sense, it doesn't really do anything.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, contrary to a now-deleted post, it doesn't keep the regexp from matching <code>http://<a href=""http://example.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.org</a></code>, since the \S+ at the end will match one or more non-whitespace characters, including the <code>http://example.org</code> in <code>http://<a href=""http://example.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.org</a></code> (verified using Python 2.5, just in case my regexp reading was off). So, the regexp given isn't really the best.

<blockquote>
  <p>For every update in the case mentioned above we are removing one
  additional read from the table if we
  use the UPSERT instead of EXISTS.
  Unfortunately for an Insert, both the
  UPSERT and IF EXISTS methods use the
  same number of reads on the table.
  Therefore the check for existence
  should only be done when there is a
  very valid reason to justify the
  additional I/O. The optimized way to
  do things is to make sure that you
  have little reads as possible on the
  DB.</p>
  
  <p>The best strategy is to attempt the
  update. If no rows are affected by the
  update then insert. In most
  circumstances, the row will already
  exist and only one I/O will be
  required.</p>

<ul>
<li>Developer modifies a shared library while working on a feature - dev has insight into possible side effects that QA / validation don't</li>

<li>Developer discovers path of use case not considered in spec that code must support, writes code, updates spec, writes test</li>
</ul>

<p>It's arguable how much test duty should be carried out by the dev in the third example, but I argue that it's most efficient for the dev because all of the related minutiae from many layers of documentation and code are already in her short-term memory. This perfect storm may not be attainable by a tester after the fact.</p>

<p>Are we talking about QA or validation? I think of QA along the lines of inspection checklists, code standards enforcement, UI guidelines, etc. If we're talking validation, it doesn't make sense for devs to spend a lot of time authoring and executing formal test cases, but devs must provide all of the rationale and design documentation needed to author good tests.</p>

14070,958,2008-08-18T01:08:58Z,14040,17,"<p>It's the difference between ""black box"" testing (where you know what the code is supposed to do, but not how it works), and ""white box"" testing (where knowing how it works drives how you test it). ""Black box"" testing is what most people think of when you mention Quality Assurance.</p>

<p>I work for a company where the QA team are also software developers.  (That narrows the field <em>a lot</em> if you care to guess the company.)  I know Joel's opinion, and my experience leads me to partially disagree: for the same reason that a ""white hat"" hacker is more effective finding security holes, certain kinds of errors are more effectively found by white box testers who know how to write code (and therefore what the common mistakes are - for example, resource management issues like memory leaks).  </p>

<p>Also, since QA-oriented developers are part of the process from the initial design phase, they can theoretically help to drive higher-quality code throughout the process.  Ideally, for each developer working on the project with a mental focus on functionality, you have an opposing developer with a mental focus on breaking the code (and thus making it better).  </p>

<p>Seen in that light, it's less a matter of using developers for testers than it is kind of disconnected pair-programming where one developer has an emphasis on controlling quality.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, a lot of testing (such as basic UI functionality) frankly doesn't need that kind of skill.  That's where Joel has a point. </p>

<p>For many businesses, I could see a system where programming teams trade off code review and testing duties for each others' code.  Members of the Business Logic team, for example, could spend an occasional tour testing and reviewing code for the UI team, and vice-versa.  That way you're not ""wasting"" developer talent on full-time testing, but you are gaining the advantages of exposing the code to (hopefully) expert scrutiny and punishment.  Then, a more traditional QA team can take up the ""black box"" testing.</p>

<p>The left half should be automated.</p>

<ul>
<li>Developer tests verify that the code works as the coder wanted it to.
  Tools: NUnit / xUnit / whatever home-made tool</li>
<li>Customer tests verify that the code works as the customer wanted it to.
The tests should be very easy to write, shouldn't require the customer to learn .NET/Java. Else the customer wont write those tests (although he may require some help of a developer). Fit for example uses HTML tables that can be written in Word.
Tools: FIT
Regression tools also lie here. Record-replay.</li>
</ul>

<p>The right half better utilizes the time &amp; effort of good testers. e.g. No automated test can tell you whether X dialog is usable. Humans are better at this than machines.</p>

<ul>
<li>Usability. Try to Break the System down,( catch unhandled failure scenarios, enter null values ). Basically catch things that the developer missed.</li>
<li>Property testing again requires humans. Here you check customer mandated properties that are required by your system. e.g. Performance - does your search dialog meet the 2 sec response time ? Security- can someone hack into this System ? etc. Availability - is your system online 99.99% of the time ?</li>

<p>But keep a few things in mind when making this decision: using any ORM couples you tightly to your data model.  A DBA has no freedom to make changes to the data model without forcing you to change your compiled code.  With stored procedures, you can hide these sorts of changes to an extent, since the parameter list and results set(s) returned from a procedure represent its contract, and the innards can be changed around, just so long as that contract is still met.</p>

<p>And also, if Linq is used for more complex queries, tuning the database becomes a much more difficult task.  When a stored procedure is running slow, the DBA can totally focus on the code in isolation, and has lots of options, just so that contract is still satisfied when he/she is done.</p>

<p>I have seen many, many cases where serious problems in an application were addressed by changes to the schema and code in stored procedures without any change to deployed, compiled code.</p>

<li>The Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 3-month trial editions are fully-functional, and can be <a href=""http://www.codingthewheel.com/archives/microsoft-vs-the-system-clock"" rel=""nofollow"">used indefinitely</a> (forever) by setting the system clock back prior to opening VS.

<li>You can use Visual Studio to open 3rd-party executables, and browse embedded resources (dialogs, string tables, images, etc) stored within.</li>
<li>Debugging visualizers are not exactly a ""hidden"" feature but they are somewhat neglected, and super-useful, since in addition to using the provided visualizers you can <a href=""http://nayyeri.net/blog/how-to-write-a-visual-studio-visualizer/"" rel=""nofollow"">roll your own</a> for specific data sets.</li>
<li>Debugger's ""Set Instruction Pointer"" or ""Set Next Statement"" command.</li>

15956,1000,2008-08-19T10:34:35Z,15690,4,"<p>This sounds very much like my first job. Straight out of university, I was asked to design the database and business logic layer, while other people would take care of the UI. Meanwhile the boss was looking over my shoulder, unwilling to let go of what used to be his baby and was now mine, and poking his finger in it. Three years later, developers were fleeing the company and we were still X months away from actually selling anything.</p>

<p>The big mistake was in being too ambitious. If this is your first job, you <em>will</em> make mistakes and you <em>will</em> need to change how things work long after you've written them. We had all sorts of features that made the system more complicated than it needed to be, both on the database level and in the API that it presented to other developers. In the end, the whole thing was just far too complicated to support all at once and just died.</p>

<p>So my advice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you're not sure about taking on such a big job single-handed, don't. Tell your employers, and get them to find or hire somebody for you to work with who can help you out. If people need to be added to the project, then it should be done near the start rather than after stuff starts going wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Think very carefully about what the product is for, and to boil it down to the <strong>simplest</strong> set of requirements you can think of. If the people giving you the spec aren't technical, try to see past what they've written to what will actually work and make money. Talk to customers and salespeople, and understand the market.</p></li>
<li><p>There's no shame in admitting you're wrong. If it turns out that the entire system needs to be rewritten, because you made some mistake in your first version, then it's better to admit this as soon as possible so you can get to it. Correspondingly, don't try to make an architecture that can anticipate every possible contingency in your first version, because you don't know what every contingency is and will just get it wrong. Write once with an eye to throwing away and starting again - you may not have to, the first version may be fine, but admit it if you do.</p></li>

{
    return (T) Enum.Parse(typeof(T), value, true);

<p>Then I can do:</p>

<pre><code>StatusEnum MyStatus = EnumUtil.ParseEnum&lt;StatusEnum&gt;(""Active"");

<p>One option suggested in the comments is to add an extension, which is simple enough:</p>

<pre><code>public static T ToEnum&lt;T&gt;(this string value)
{
    return (T) Enum.Parse(typeof(T), value, true);
}

StatusEnum MyStatus = ""Active"".ToEnum&lt;StatusEnum&gt;();

    {

<p>Which makes this the call:</p>

<pre><code>StatusEnum MyStatus = ""Active"".ToEnum(StatusEnum.None);

<p>However, I would be careful adding an extension method like this to <code>string</code> as (without namespace control) it will appear on all instances of <code>string</code> whether they hold an enum or not (so <code>1234.ToString().ToEnum(StatusEnum.None)</code> would be valid but nonsensical) .

<p>The simplest hash I ever learned was simply XORing all the bytes together.  It's easy, faster than most complicated hash algorithms and a halfway decent general-purpose hash algorithm for small data sets.  It's the Bubble Sort of hash algorithms really.  Since the simple implementation would leave you with 8 bits, that's only 256 hashes ... not so hot.  You could XOR chunks instead of individal bytes, but then the algorithm gets much more complicated.</p>

<p>So certainly, the cryptographic algorithms are maybe doing some stuff you don't need ... but they're also a huge step up in general-purpose hash quality.  The MD5 hash you're using has 128 bits, with billions and billions of possible hashes.  The only way you're likely to get something better is to take some representative samples of the data you expect to be going through your application and try various algorithms on it to see how many collisions you get.</p>

  and or the size of the PDF without
  lowering the total page count?</li>

<p>I have a few ideas and questions:<br />
1. Is this a graphics-heavy report?  If not, do you have tables that start out as text but are converted into a graphic by the SSRS PDF renderer (check if you can select the text in the PDF)?  41K per page might be more than it should be, or it might not, depending on how information-dense your report is.  But we've had cases where we had minor issues with a report's layout, like having a table bleed into the page's margins, that resulted in the SSRS PDF renderer ""throwing up its hands"" and rendering the table as an image instead of as text.  Obviously, the fewer graphics in your report, the smaller your file size will be.<br />
2. Is there a way that you could easily break the report into pieces?  E.g., if it's a 10-location report, where Location 1 is followed by Location 2, etc., on your final report, could you run the Location 1 portion independent of the Location 2 portion, etc.?  If so, you could join the 10 sub-reports into one final PDF using <a href=""http://pdfsharp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">PDFSharp</a> after you've received them all.  This leads to some difficulties with page numbering, but nothing insurmountable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3. Does anyone else have any other
  theories as to why this runs on the
  server but not through the API?</p>

<p>My guess would be the sheer size of the report.  I don't remember everything about what's an IIS setting and what's SSRS-specific, but there might be some overall IIS settings (maybe in Metabase.xml) that you would have to be updated to even allow that much data to pass through. </p>

<p>You could isolate the question of whether the time is the problem by taking one of your working reports and building in a long wait time in your stored procedures with WAITFOR (assuming SQL Server for your DBMS).</p>

16817,1996,2008-08-19T19:51:39Z,16140,36,"<p>Well, since you can not have one part OSGi and one part non-OSGi you'll need to make your entire app OSGi. In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc).</p>

<p>To take it to the next level you'll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.</p>

<p>Some help can come from tools like <a href=""http://clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html"">JDepend</a> which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system. A package with low efferent coupling should be easier to extract into an OSGi bundle than one with high efferent coupling. Even more architectural insight can be had with pro tools like <a href=""http://www.headwaysoftware.com/products/structure101/index.php"">Structure 101</a>.</p>

<p>Purely on a technical level, working daily with an application that consists of 160 OSGi bundles and using Spring DM I can confirm that the transition from ""normal"" Spring to Spring DM is largely pain free. The extra namespace and the fact that you can (and should) isolate your OSGi specific Spring configuration in separate files makes it even easier to have both with and without OSGi deployment scenarios.</p>

17177,736,2008-08-19T23:17:07Z,17170,2,"<p>I don't think there are hard and fast rules for this type of thing, but I usually go by the guideline of using the lightest possible way until absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>For example, let's say you have a <code>Person</code> class and a <code>Group</code> class. A <code>Group</code> instance has many people, so a List here would make sense. When I declare the list object in <code>Group</code> I will use an <code>IList&lt;Person&gt;</code> and instantiate it as a <code>List</code>.</p>

<pre><code>public class Group {
  private IList&lt;Person&gt; people;

  public Group() {
    this.people = new List&lt;Person&gt;();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And, if you don't even need everything in <code>IList</code> you can always use <code>IEnumerable</code> too. With modern compilers and processors, I don't think there is really any speed difference, so this is more just a matter of style.</p>

    // Do some stuff with the IList array
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will allow me to do generic processing on almost any array in the .NET framework, unless it uses IEnumerable and not IList, which happens sometimes.</p>

<p>It really comes down to the kind of functionality you need. I'd suggest using the List class in most cases. IList is best for when you need to make a custom array that could have some very specific rules that you'd like to encapsulate within a collection so you don't repeat yourself, but still want .NET to recognize it as a list.</p>

But if you're interacting with outside code, like when you're returning a list from a method, then you only want to declare the interface without necessarily tying yourself to a specific implementation, especially if you have no control over who compiles against your code afterward. If you started with a concrete type and you decided to change to another one, even if it uses the same interface, you're going to break someone else's code unless you started off with an interface or abstract base type. </p>

<ul>

<p>So when writing a function or method that takes a collection, write it not to take a List, but an IList&lt;T&gt;, an ICollection&lt;T&gt;, or IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;.  The generic interfaces will still work even for heterogenous lists because System.Object can be a T too.  Doing this will save you headache if you decide to use a Stack or some other data structure further down the road.  If all you need to do in the function is foreach through it, IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; is really all you should be asking for.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when returning an object out of a function, you want to give the user the richest possible set of operations without them having to cast around.  So in that case, if it's a List&lt;T&gt; internally, return a copy as a List&lt;T&gt;.</p>

<p>(Sorry if it's a little dense.  Markdown seems to be stripping out the blank lines.)</p>

<p>It's pretty simple though once you understand the concepts and all the dependencies are handled automatically.  I should note that we use Visual Studio project files, which have a lot of logic built into them, but this system allows people to build almost identically both within the Visual Studio IDE or at the command line and still gives you the flexibility of adding things to the canonical build like the xUnit testing you see in the script above.</p>

<p>The one PropertyGroup is where all the configuration happens and things can be customized, like excluding certain projects from the build or adding new test assembly masks.</p>

<p>The ItemGroup is where the logic happens that finds all the .csproj files in the tree.</p>

<p>Then there are the targets, which most people familiar with make, nAnt or MSBuild should be able to follow.  If you call the Build target, it calls <em>_Compile, _</em>Deploy and __Test.  The Clean target calls MSBuild on all the project files for them to clean up their directories and then the global deployment directory is deleted.  Rebuild calls Clean and then Build.</p>"

But if you are really starting off on your career then you should be least worried about the specialization thing. All APIs, frameworks and skills that you expect that gives you a long term existence in the field is not going to happen.

<p>Recent versions of <a href=""http://developer.nvidia.com/object/sdk_home.html"">NVIDIA OpenGL SDK</a> ship with GLEW. If you're using this, then you don't need to do some of the following steps.</p>

<p>Download <a href=""http://glew.sourceforge.net/"">GLEW</a> and unzip it.</p>

<p>Add the GLEW <strong>bin</strong> path to your Windows <strong>PATH</strong> environment variable. Alternatively, you can also place the <strong>glew32.dll</strong> in a directory where Windows picks up its DLLs.</p>

<p>Add the GLEW <strong>include</strong> path to your compiler's include directory list.</p>

<p>Add the GLEW <strong>lib</strong> path to your compiler's library directory list.</p>

<p>Instruct your compiler to use <strong>glew32.lib</strong> during linking. If you're using Visual C++ compilers then one way to do this is by adding the following line to your code:</p>

<pre><code>#pragma comment(lib, ""glew32.lib"")
</code></pre>

<p>Add a <code>#include &lt;GL/glew.h&gt;</code> line to your code. Ensure that this is placed above the includes of other GL header files. (You may actually not need the GL header files includes if you include <code>glew.h</code>.)</p>

<p>Initialize GLEW using <code>glewInit()</code> after you've initialized GLUT or GL. If it fails, then something is wrong with your setup.</p>

<pre><code>if (GLEW_OK != glewInit())
{
    // GLEW failed!
    exit(1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Check if the extension(s) you wish to use are now available through GLEW. You do this by checking a boolean variable named <strong>GLEW<em>_your_extension_name</em></strong> which is exposed by GLEW.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>if (!GLEW_EXT_framebuffer_object)
{
    exit(1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! You can now use the OpenGL extension calls in your code just as if they existed naturally for Windows.</p>"

In general, I have not seen the behaviour since then either, and really it shouldn't be a problem at all if your system isn't also doing IO intensive tasks.

    // init directinput

Higher-reaching concepts would probably include WPF (maybe Silverlight as well), LINQ (or your ORM of choice), as well as the Vista bridge and related bridging code if your project includes desktop apps at all. Those three things seem to be the focus for this round of .NET. Something else that's very important to have at least a passing knowledge of is the ways that .NET code can/must interoperate with native code: P/Invoke, Runtime Callable Wrapping and COM Callable Wrapping. There are still a lot of native things that don't have a .NET equivalent.</p>

<ol>
<li>OS dependent</li>
<li>Not quite clear what you're trying to do.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nevertheless, I'll try to provide some information for you to decide.<br />
On UNIX, <code>fork()</code> creates a clone of your process from the place where you called fork. Meaning, if I have the following process:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    printf( ""hi 2 u\n"" );
    int mypid = fork();

    if( 0 == mypid )
        printf( ""lol child\n"" );
    else
        printf( ""lol parent\n"" );

    return( 0 );
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output will look as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>hi 2 u<br />
    lol child<br />
    lol parent  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>When you <code>fork()</code> the pid returned in the child is 0, and the pid returned in the parent is the child's pid. Notice that ""hi2u"" is only printed once... by the <strong>parent</strong>.</p>

<p><code>execve()</code> and its family of functions are almost always used with <code>fork().</code> <code>execve()</code> and the like overwrite the current stackframe with the name of the application you pass to it. <code>execve()</code> is almost always used with <code>fork()</code> where you fork a child process and if you're the parent you do whatever you need to keep doing and if you're the child you exec a new process. <code>execve()</code> is also almost always used with <code>waitpid()</code> -- waitpid takes a pid of a child process and, quite literally, <em>waits</em> until the child terminates and returns the child's exit status to you.  </p>

<p>Using this information, you should be able to write a very basic shell; one that takes process names on the command line and runs processes you tell it to. Of course, shells do more than that, like piping input and output, but you should be able to accomplish the basics using <code>fork()</code>, <code>execve()</code> and <code>waitpid()</code>.</p>

<p>Design experience is an investment not only in Designers with artistic skill, but also in the knowledge and tools provided by Adobe.  You can nearly guarantee that a professional designer uses a mac and has experience with Adobe tools.</p>

<p>The good news is that Xcode 3 and later come with superb auto-completion and template support.  By default, you have to explicitly request completion by hitting the escape key.  (This actually works in all <code>NSTextView</code>s; try it!)  If you want to have the completions appear automatically, you can go to <strong>Preferences</strong> -> <strong>Code Sense</strong> and set the pop-up to appear automatically after a few seconds.  You should find good completions for C and Objective-C code, and pretty good completions for C++.</p>

<p>Xcode also has a solid template/skeleton system that you can use.  You can see what templates are available by default by going to Edit -> Insert Text Macro.  Of course, you don't want to insert text macros with the mouse; that defeats the point.  Instead, you have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Back in <strong>Preferences</strong>,go to <strong>Key Bindings</strong>, and then, under <strong>Menu Key Bindings</strong>, assign a specific shortcut to macros you use often.  I personally don't bother doing this, but I know plenty of great Mac devs who do</li>
<li><p>Use the <code>CompletionPrefix</code>.  By default, nearly all of the templates have a special prefix that, if you type and then hit the escape key, will result in the template being inserted.  You can use Control-/ to move between the completion fields.</p>

<p>You can see <a href=""http://crookedspin.com/2005/06/10/xcode-macros/"">a full list of Xcode's default macros and their associated <code>CompletionPrefix</code>es</a> at <a href=""http://crookedspin.com"">Crooked Spin</a>.</p>

<p>You can also add your own macros, or modify the defaults.  To do so, edit the file <code>/Developer/Library/Xcode/Specifications/{C,HTML}.xctxtmacro</code>.  The syntax should be self-explanatory, if not terribly friendly.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Unfortunately, if you're addicted to R#, you will be disappointed by your refactoring options.  Basic refactoring is provided within Xcode through the context menu or by hitting Shift-Apple-J.  From there, you can extract and rename methods, promote and demote them through the class hierarchy, and a few other common operations.

<p>Take the task of finding the intersection of two lists:</p>

  <p>I want to add a rule that checks for
  the presence of a folder.jpg file in
  each directory, but to add this would
  make the code substantially more messy
  in it's current state..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This doesn't look bad.  In fact your current code does it very nicely, and Sven mentioned a good way to do it as well:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a list of all the files</li>
<li>Check for ""required"" files</li>
</ol>

<p>You would just have have add to your dictionary a list of required files:</p>

<pre><code>checker = {
  ...
  'required': ['file', 'list', 'for_required']
}
</code></pre>

<p>As far as there being a better/extensible way to do this?  I am not exactly sure.  I could only really think of a way to possibly drop the ""multiple"" regular expressions and build off of Sven's idea for using a delimiter.  So my strategy would be defining a dictionary as follows (and I'm sorry I don't know Python syntax and I'm a tad to lazy to look it up but it should make sense.  The /regex/ is shorthand for a regex):</p>

<pre><code>check_dict = {
  'delim'    : /\-/,
  'parts'    : [ 'Show Name', 'Episode Name', 'Episode Number' ],
  'patterns' : [/valid name/, /valid episode name/, /valid number/ ],
  'required' : ['list', 'of', 'files'],
  'ignored'  : ['.*', 'hidden.txt'],
  'start_dir': '/path/to/dir/to/test/'
}
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Split the filename based on the delimiter.</li>
<li>Check each of the parts.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because its an ordered list you can determine what parts are missing and if a section doesn't match any pattern it is malformed.  Here the <code>parts</code> and <code>patterns</code> have a 1 to 1 ratio.  Two arrays instead of a dictionary enforces the order.</p>

<p>Ignored and required files can be listed.  The <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> files should probably be ignored automatically.  The user should be allowed to input ""globs"" which can be shell expanded.  I'm thinking here of <code>svn:ignore</code> properties, but globbing is natural for listing files.</p>

<p>Here <code>start_dir</code> would be default to the current directory but if you wanted a single file to run automated testing of a bunch of directories this would be useful.</p>

<p>The real loose end here is the path template and along the same lines what path is required for ""valid files"".  I really couldn't come up with a solid idea without writing one large regular expression and taking groups from it... to build a template.  It felt a lot like writing a TextMate language grammar.  But that starts to stray on the ease of use.  The real problem was that the path template was not composed of <code>parts</code>, which makes sense but adds complexity.</p>

<p>Is this strategy in tune with what you were thinking of?</p>"

21418,332,2008-08-21T23:20:41Z,21280,5,"<p>LINQ is not just an ORM system, as Jonathan pointed out it brings a lot of functional programming elements to C#. And it lets you do a lot of ""database-y"" things in regular C# code. It's difficult to explain just how incredibly powerful that can be. Consider how much having solid, well designed generic data structures (such as list, stack, dictionary/hash, etc.) included in common frameworks has improved the state of development in modern languages. Precisely because using these data structures is very common and reducing the intellectual overhead of using them is a huge benefit. LINQ doesn't do anything you can't do yourself, but it makes a lot of operations a lot more straightforward and a lot easier.</p>

<p>Consider the time-honored example of removing duplicates from a non-ordered list. In a lower level language like C or C++ you'd probably have to sort the list and maintain two indices into the list as you removed dupes. In a language with hashes (Java, C#, Javascript, Perl, etc.) you could create a hash where the keys are the unique values, then extract the keys into a new list. With LINQ you could just do this:</p>

21967,1630,2008-08-22T09:13:56Z,21560,3,"<p>I finally got Multisampling working with my wxWidgets OpenGL program. It's a bit messy right now, but here's how:</p>

<p><strong>wxWidgets</strong> doesn't have <strong>Multisampling</strong> support in their <strong>stable releases</strong> right now (latest version at this time is <strong>2.8.8</strong>). But, it's available as a patch and also through their daily snapshot. (The latter is heartening, since it means that the patch has been accepted and should appear in later stable releases if there are no issues.)</p>

<p>So, there are 2 options:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download and build from their <strong><a href=""http://biolpc22.york.ac.uk/pub/Daily_HEAD/"" rel=""nofollow"">daily snapshot</a></strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Get the <strong><a href=""https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;atid=309863&amp;aid=1915804&amp;group_id=9863"" rel=""nofollow"">patch</a></strong> for your working wxWidgets installation.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I found the 2nd option to be less cumbersome, since I don't want to disturb my working installation as much as possible. If you don't know how to patch on Windows, see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19611/"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>.</p>

<p>At the very least, for Windows, the patch will modify the following files:</p>

<pre><code>$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/include/wx/glcanvas.h
$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/include/wx/msw/glcanvas.h
$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/src/msw/glcanvas.cpp
</code></pre>

<p>After patching, <strong>recompile</strong> the wxWidgets libraries.</p>

<p>To enable multisampling in your wxWidgets OpenGL program, minor changes to the code are required.</p>

<p>An attribute list needs to be passed to the <strong>wxGLCanvas</strong> constructor:</p>

<pre><code>int attribList[] = {WX_GL_RGBA,
                    WX_GL_DOUBLEBUFFER,
                    WX_GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS, GL_TRUE, // Multi-sampling
                    WX_GL_DEPTH_SIZE, 16,
                    0, 0};
</code></pre>

<p>If you were already using an attribute list, then add the line with <code>GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS, GL_TRUE</code> to it. Else, add this attribute list definition to your code.</p>

<p>Then modify your wxGLCanvas constructor to take this attribute list as a parameter:</p>

<pre><code>myGLFrame::myGLFrame    // Derived from wxGLCanvas
(
    wxWindow *parent,
    wxWindowID id,
    const wxPoint&amp; pos,
    const wxSize&amp; size,
    long style,
    const wxString&amp; name
)
: wxGLCanvas(parent, (wxGLCanvas*) NULL, id, pos, size, style, name, attribList)
{
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>After the wxGLCanvas element is created, multisampling is turned on by default. To disable or enable it at will, use the related OpenGL calls:</p>

<pre><code>glEnable(GL_MULTISAMPLE);
glDisable(GL_MULTISAMPLE);
</code></pre>

<p>Multisampling should now work with the wxWidgets OpenGL program. Hopefully, it should be supported in the stable release of wxWidgets soon, making this information irrelevant :-)</p>"

<p>I don't think there's a technical limitation as such on shipping System.Web as part of your app, though it's slightly odd that they've put that notice in on the .NET 3.5 page. Hanselman actually says he started out being creeped out by this notion, but became convinced.

  <p>I do store all dates in GMT. Here's the use case: something happened at 11:00 PM EST on the 1st, which is the 2nd GMT. I want to see activity for the 1st, and I am in EST so I will want to see the 11PM activity. If I just compared raw GMT datetimes, I would miss things.

<p>Right, but when you say you're interested in activity for Jan 1st 2008 EST:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT @activityDateMidnight = '1/1/2008', @activityDateTZ = 'EST'
</code></pre>

<p>you just need to convert <em>that</em> to GMT (I'm ignoring the complication of querying for the day before EST goes to EDT, or vice versa):</p>

<pre><code>Table: TimeZone
Fields: TimeZone, Offset
Values: EST, -4

--Multiply by -1, since we're converting EST to GMT.
--Offsets are to go from GMT to EST.
SELECT @activityGmtBegin = DATEADD(hh, Offset * -1, @activityDateMidnight)
FROM TimeZone
WHERE TimeZone = @activityDateTZ
</code></pre>

<p>which should give you '1/1/2008 4:00 AM'. Then, you can just search in GMT:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM EventTable
WHERE 
   EventTime &gt;= @activityGmtBegin --1/1/2008 4:00 AM
   AND EventTime &lt; (@activityGmtBegin + 1) --1/2/2008 4:00 AM
</code></pre>

<p>The event in question is stored with a GMT EventTime of 1/2/2008 3:00 AM. You don't even need the TimeZone in the EventTable (for this purpose, at least). </p>

<p>Since EventTime is not in a function, this is a straight index scan - which should be pretty efficient. Make EventTime your clustered index, and it'll fly. ;)</p>

<p>I actually think this is an interesting question. I'm not sure how useful it is, but it is a valid question.</p>

<p>@Ed</p>

<p>Can you provide a little more info on this question? You said the dimension of the array is dynamic, but is the number of elements dynamic as well?</p>

<p>EDIT: I'm going to try and answer the question anyways. I can't give you the code off the top of my head (it would take a while to get it right without any compiler here on this PC), but I can point you in the right direction ...</p>

<p>Let's use 8 dimensions (0-7) with indexes 0 to 3 as an example. You care about only 1,2 and 6. This means you have two arrays. First, <code>array_care[4][4][4]</code> for 1,2, and 6. The <code>array_care[4][4][4]</code> will hold the end result.</p>

<p>Next, we want to iterate in a very specific way. We have the array <code>input[4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4]</code> to parse through, and we care about dimensions 1, 2, and 6.</p>

<p>We need to define some temporary indexes:</p>

<pre><code>int dim[8] = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};
</code></pre>

<p>We also need to store the order in which we want to increase the indexes:</p>

<pre><code>int increase_index_order[8] = {7,5,4,3,0,6,2,1};
int i = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>This order is important for doing what you requested.</p>

<p>Define a termination flag:</p>

<pre><code>bool terminate=false;
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can create our loop:</p>

<pre><code>while (terminate)
{
array_care[dim[1]][dim[2]][dim[6]] += input[dim[0]][dim[1]][dim[2]][dim[3]][dim[4]][dim[5]][dim[6]][dim[7]];

while ((dim[increase_index_order[i]] = 3) &amp;&amp; (i &lt; 8))
{
dim[increase_index_order[i]]=0;
i++;
}

if (i &lt; 8) {
dim[increase_index_order[i]]++; i=0;
} else {
terminate=true;
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>That should work for 8 dimensions, caring about 3 dimensions. It would take a bit more time to make it dynamic, and I don't have the time. Hope this helps. I apologize, but I haven't learned the code markups yet. :(</p>"

<p>I wouldn't fret over it. I would just make sure the code is as aesthetically pleasing as possible according to your own tastes. If you ask 10 programmers how to format code, you are going to get about 15 different opinions. A better thing to focus on is how the code is factored. Are things abstracted right? Did I pick meaningful names for things? Is there a lot of code duplication? Are there ways I can simplify stuff? Getting those things right, I think, will have the greatest positive impact on your project, your code, your job, and your life. Coincidentally, it will probably also cause the other guy to grumble the least. If your code works, is easy to read, and is well factored, the other guy isn't going to be scrutinizing how you initialize fields. He's just going to use your code, marvel at it's greatness, and then move on to something else.</p>"

This idea leads to the notion of the <strong><em>class</em></strong> that seperates the interface from implementation. These are hugely important concepts and the basis for putting a framework in place to think about program design in a different way and better (I think) way. You can't really argue against those properties - there is no trade-off made and it is always a cleaner way to modulize things.</p>

<p>Other aspects of OOP including inheritance and polymorphism are important too, but as others have alluded to, those are commonly over used. ie: Sometimes people use inheritance and/or polymorphism because they can, not because they should have. They are powerful concepts and very useful, but need to be used wisely and are not automatic winning advantages of OOP.</p>

<p>Relative to re-use. I agree re-use is over sold for OOP. It is a possible side effect of well defined objects, typically of more primitive/generic classes and is a direct result of the encapsulation and information hiding concepts. It is potentially easier to be re-used because the interfaces of well defined classes are just simply clearer and somewhat self documenting.</p>

<p>Yes, I find this to be too prevalent as well. This is not Object Oriented Programming. It's Object Based Programming and data centric programing. In my 10 years of working with OO Languages, I see people mostly doing Object Based Programming. OBP breaks down very quickly IMHO since you are essentially getting the worst of both words: 1) Procedural programming without adhering to proven structured programming methodology and 2) OOP without adhering to to proven OOP methodology.  </p>

<p>OOP done right is a beautiful thing. It makes very difficult problems easy to solve, and to the uninitiated (not trying to sound pompous there), it can almost seem like magic. That being said, OOP is just one tool in the toolbox of programming methodologies. It is not the be all end all methodology. It just happens to suit large business applications well.   </p>

<p>Most developers who work in OOP languages are utilizing examples of OOP done right in the frameworks and types that they use day-to-day, but they just aren't aware of it. Here are some very simple examples: ADO.NET, Hibernate/NHibernate, Logging Frameworks, various language collection types, the ASP.NET stack, The JSP stack etc...

<p>At the very least, make sure old cookies lose their value after a while. Even a successful hijaking attack will be thwarted when the cookie stops working.

Make sure that whenever a user clicks on your site's ""log out"" link, that the old session UUID can never be used again. </p>

<p>I'm not sure if this idea will work but here goes: Add a serial number into your session cookie, maybe a string like this:</p>

<p>SessionUUID, Serial Num, Current Date/Time</p>

<p>Encrypt this string and use it as your session cookie. Regularly change the serial num - maybe when the cookie is 5 minutes old and then reissue the cookie.  You could even reissue it on every page view if you wanted to. On the server side, keep a record of the last serial num you've issued for that session.  If someone ever sends a cookie with the wrong serial number it means that an attacker may be using a cookie they intercepted earlier so invalidate the session UUID and ask the user to reenter their password and then reissue a new cookie.</p>

24645,122,2008-08-23T21:57:11Z,24620,1,"<p>I am in agreement with jjnguy... I think the reasons to seal a class are few and far between.  Quite the contrary, I have been in the situation more than once where I want to extend a class, but couldn't because it was sealed.</p>

<p>As a perfect example, I was recently creating a small package (Java, not C#, but same principles) to wrap functionality around the memcached tool.  I wanted an interface so in tests I could mock away the memcached client API I was using, and also so we could switch clients if the need arose (there are 2 clients listed on the memcached homepage).  Additionally, I wanted to have the opportunity to replace the functionality altogether if the need or desire arose (such as if the memcached servers are down for some reason, we could potentially hot swap with a local cache implementation instead).</p>

<p>I exposed a minimal interface to interact with the client API, and it would have been awesome to extend the client API class and then just add an implements clause with my new interface.  The methods that I had in the interface that matched the actual interface would then need no further details and so I wouldn't have to explicitly implement them.  However, the class was sealed, so I had to instead proxy calls to an internal reference to this class.  The result: more work and a lot more code for no real good reason.</p>

<p>That said, I think there are potential times when you might want to make a class sealed... and the best thing I can think of is an API that you will invoke directly, but allow clients to implement.  For example, a game where you can program against the game... if your classes were not sealed, then the players who are adding features could potentially exploit the API to their advantage.  This is a very narrow case though, and I think any time you have full control over the codebase, there really is little if any reason to make a class sealed.</p>

<p>This is one reason I really like the Ruby programming language... even the core classes are open, not just to extend but to ADD AND CHANGE functionality dynamically, TO THE CLASS ITSELF!  It's called monkeypatching and can be a nightmare if abused, but it's damn fun to play with!</p>"
24652,855,2008-08-23T22:01:43Z,24620,0,"<p>Not everything that's important in a class is asserted easily in code. There can be semantics and relationships present that are easily broken by inheriting and overriding methods. Overriding one method at a time is an easy way to do this.  You design a class/object as a single meaningful entity and then someone comes along and thinks if a method or two were 'better' it would do no harm.  That may or may not be true.  Maybe you can correctly separate all methods between private and not private or virtual and not virtual but that still may not be enough. Demanding inheritance of all classes also puts a huge additional burden on the original developer to foresee all the ways an inheriting class could screw things up.<br />
I don't know of a perfect solution. I'm sympathetic to preventing inheritance but that's also a problem because it hinders unit testing. </p>

<p>All the other reasons I've seen mentioned so far boil down to ""nobody touches my class!"". If you're worried someone might misunderstand its internals, you did a poor job documenting it. You can't possibly know that there's nothing useful to add to your class, or that you already know every imaginable use case for it. Even if you're right and the other developer shouldn't have used your class to solve their problem, using a keyword isn't a great way of preventing such a mistake. Documentation is.

<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25450/abstraction-away-from-css#25457"" rel=""nofollow"">CSS is good</a>! <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25450/abstraction-away-from-css#25462"" rel=""nofollow"">To expand further</a>, there is a learning curve but once you learn it many things will be much easier.</li>
<li>(Some) Browser inconsistencies <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25450/abstraction-away-from-css#25471"" rel=""nofollow"">are solvable</a> generically.</li>
<li>(Some of your) <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25450/abstraction-away-from-css#25467"" rel=""nofollow"">Variable and calculated</a> field functionality can be taken care of through whatever templating engine you use.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think a combination of all these certianly solves a large sum of problems (although to be fair deeply learning CSS is not an option for everyone; some people just don't use it enough to justify the time).</p>

<p>There are some problems none of the above points cover (certain types of calculated fields would require writing a JS library for, me thinks) but it's certainly a good start.</p>"
25525,1344,2008-08-25T01:05:01Z,25450,10,"<p>If by some chance you happen to be using Ruby, there's <a href=""http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/rdoc/classes/Sass.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Sass</a>. It supports hierarchical selectors (using indentation to establish hierarchies), among other things, which makes life easier to an extend from a syntactical perspective (you repeat yourself a lot less). </p>

<p>I am certainly with you, though. While I would consider myself a small-time CSS expert, I think it would be nice if there were tools for CSS like there are with Javascript (Prototype, JQuery, etc.). You tell the tool what you want, and it handles the browser inconsistencies behind-the-scenes. That would be ideal, methinks.</p>
"
25534,40,2008-08-25T01:17:19Z,25450,6,"<p>This elaborates on my previous answer.</p>

<p>When I first started using CSS I also thought it was a pain that it didn't support variables, expressions, etc.  But as I started to use it more and more, I developed a different style to overcome these issues.  </p>

<p>For example, instead of this:</p>

<pre><code>a { color: red }
.entry { color: red }
h1 { color: red }
</code></pre>

<p>You can do:</p>

<pre><code>a, .entry, h1 { color: red }
</code></pre>

<p>You can keep the color declared in one spot by doing this.</p>

<p>Once you use CSS enough you should be able to overcome most browser inconsistencies easily.  If you find that you need to use a CSS hack there is probably a better way to do it.</p>"

<li>Solid Documentation - The docs are clear and to the point, with great examples</li>
<li>Deep per-platform support - There are some unique features in the window service management system that are supported perfectly by service wrapper (w/o restarting).  And on Windows, you will even see your app name in the process list instead of just ""java.exe"".</li>
<li>Standards Compliant - Unlike many ad-hoc Java init scripts, the scripts for service wrapper tend to be compliant with LSB standards.  This can end up being very important if you ever want high availability management from something like Linux Heartbeat/HA.</li>

25553,149,2008-08-25T01:51:33Z,25450,2,"<p>For variable support, I have used PHP with CSS headers to great effect for that. I think you can do it in any language. Here is a php sample: </p>
